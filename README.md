About:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developing an edge-avoidance car using Arduino and infrared (IR) sensors, the project prioritizes the implementation of a streamlined if-else logic for precise edge detection and avoidance. Embracing a modular and open design philosophy, the project ensures accessibility for developers with varying skill levels. Through this exploration into the intersection of hardware and coding within the autonomous vehicle domain, the objective is to contribute to a broader understanding of practical applications in robotics and technology.
